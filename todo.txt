LOGISTICS:
- [ set up ssg
    - options: eleventy, pug, hugo, next.js 
    - musa uses gulp with pug, has bin/build_and_publish and gulpfile.js
    - we want to avoid lots of js, large npm dependency tree, etc, something simple instead

- server things (see .todo-htaccess)
    [ redirects
    - error pages - done by cloudflare. 403 page made but /css/ goes to 404 - why?
    - guess extensions (i.e suppress .html and the like): done by cloudflare

    - force https://
    security
    - clickjacking (low priority)
    - csp, cross site scripting, xss attacks - done by cloudflare?
    - [ which directories are allowed - this is important!
    - make sure configuration files, build scripts, metadata, etc are not public
    - is mime sniffing an issue? probably only if I take user-uploaded content 
    expires headers
    better versioning than querystrings

- app icon and site.webmanifest if I want to make it pinnable to taskbar / home screens

- musa also has browserconfig.xml, .editorconfig, .gitattributes (in public_html) and musa-website.iml outside
