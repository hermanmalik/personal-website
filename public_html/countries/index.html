         <p>ok wow I guess I spent an hour on this but the answer is somewhere around 50:</p>
<p><strong>main ones (5)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>americas + greenland (shares a border with canada at hans island)</li>
<li>uk + ireland</li>
<li>afro-eurasia (includes malaysia / indonesia / papua new guinea)</li>
<li>dominican republic + haiti</li>
<li>antarctica (this can count as 1-4 landmasses. specifically, the slice of antarctica called marie byrd land is unclaimed. at the time of writing (may 1 2024) google maps shows most marie byrd islands attached to the mainland except for 3 super tiny pieces - forrester island, burke island, and an unnamed island. there's a number of smaller pieces that are all &lt; 1 sq mi and I can't tell if they're above water or not from the satellite photos. note that the largest islands, carney and thurston, are at the moment attached to the mainland.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>countries with no land borders, from wikipedia (39):</strong>
(note that territories + constituent countries like christmas island, jersey, aruba, etc are counted as part of the country claiming them. you'd get a lot more with the british overseas territories and all the other stuff in the carribean)
Antigua and Barbuda
Australia<br>
Bahamas</p>
<ul>
<li>not bahrain because it shockingly has a land border
Barbados
Cape Verde
Comoros
Cuba</li>
<li>cyprus I suppose depending on your politics

Iceland
Jamaica
Japan (post 1945)
Kiribati

Marshall Islands<br>
Mauritius
Federated States of Micronesia
Nauru
