meta-description: landmasses mod countries 

---

ok wow I guess I spent an hour on this but the answer is somewhere around 50:

**main ones (5)**
- americas + greenland (shares a border with canada at hans island)
- uk + ireland
- afro-eurasia (includes malaysia / indonesia / papua new guinea)
- dominican republic + haiti
- antarctica (? this might count as many landmasses, eg see the two islands below)

**islands claimed by no one and micronations (8, but really could be more or less):**
- carney island
- thurston island (this is in fact a three manifold) 
- Kingdom of Redonda
- Principality of Islandia
- Kingdom of Elleore
- Dominion of Melchizedek (exists solely for fraud)
- Kingdom of EnenKio (if we're being generous)
- Naminara Republic (also if we're being very generous)
(not counting private islands since just about all of them are under the jurisdiction of some country)
(as an aside, the wikipedia pages on terra nullius, uninhabitated islands, and micronations are pretty cool. rest in peace gay and lesbian kingdom of the coral sea islands)

**countries with no land borders, from wikipedia (39):**
(note that territories like christmas island, jersey, etc are counted as part of the country they belong to instead. you'd get a lot more with the british overseas territories and all the other stuff in the carribean)
 Antigua and Barbuda
