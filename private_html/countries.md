meta-description: landmasses mod countries

ok wow I guess I spent an hour on this but the answer is somewhere around 50:

**main ones (5)**
- americas + greenland (shares a border with canada at hans island)
- uk + ireland
- afro-eurasia (includes malaysia / indonesia / papua new guinea)
- dominican republic + haiti
- antarctica (this can count as 1-4 landmasses. specifically, the slice of antarctica called marie byrd land is unclaimed. at the time of writing (may 1 2024) google maps shows most marie byrd islands attached to the mainland except for 3 super tiny pieces - forrester island, burke island, and an unnamed island. there's a number of smaller pieces that are all < 1 sq mi and I can't tell if they're above water or not from the satellite photos. note that the largest islands, carney and thurston, are at the moment attached to the mainland.)


**countries with no land borders, from wikipedia (39):**
(note that territories + constituent countries like christmas island, jersey, aruba, etc are counted as part of the country claiming them. you'd get a lot more with the british overseas territories and all the other stuff in the carribean)
 Antigua and Barbuda
 Australia    
 Bahamas
- not bahrain because it shockingly has a land border
 Barbados
 Cape Verde
 Comoros
 Cuba
- cyprus I suppose depending on your politics
 Dominica
 Fiji
 Grenada
 Iceland
 Jamaica
 Japan (post 1945)
 Kiribati
 Madagascar
 Maldives
 Malta
 Marshall Islands    
 Mauritius
 Federated States of Micronesia
 Nauru
 New Zealand (today's tradle answer)
 Palau
 Philippines
 Saint Kitts and Nevis
 Saint Lucia
 Saint Vincent and the Grenadines
 Samoa
 São Tomé and Príncipe

 Singapore (surprisingly!)
 Solomon Islands
 Sri Lanka
 Taiwan (also depending on your politics)

I'm also pretty sure there's a few little islands I missed but whatever
